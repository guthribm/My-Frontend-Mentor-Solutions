# Hello and welcome!
Hello, my name is Brandon and I am new to web design. I've been studying a course from Udemy on web developement for about a month now.
My methods may not be the best as far as layout choice, postioning, etc but I am open to feedback on my design. The following is my solution 
and a very brief overview of my process and what I learned. Thank you for taking the time to read this!

## My process

**Third newbie challenge down and feeling much more confident in my HTML5 and CSS3 abilities. Designed this**
**mobile-first and desktop second. Took some advice from a comment and tweeked my media query techniques and**
**pretty happy with the finished product. Began to learn the difficult lesson of mixing rem, px, and vw/vh**
**can be error prone**

### Built with
